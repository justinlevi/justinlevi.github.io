Welcome to the inaugural post of this blog. Time will tell if I post more. This was mainly a lesson in git pages to see if I could get it working. Seems I have. At any rate, this post features the kind of tutorial on starting with git that I wish I'd have been able to find when I was first starting out. 

I know for a fact that there are other tutorials which are both more concise and succinct. The point here isn't to be concise or succinct. The point is to slowly step through some very simple git processes in order to gain a rudimentary understanding in git.
